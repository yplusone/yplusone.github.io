Hello, I am a Fourth-year Ph.D. student in the School of Computer Science at Zhejiang University. My areas of interest include query optimization, AI4DB, HTAP systems. I welcome any opportunities to engage in discussions and collaborations.

Projects
======
- **Adaptive Memory Management for HTAP Systems** [Technical Report](files/TwistedTwin_tech_report.pdf)

  Designed an adaptive memory management approach for lightweight HTAP systems, improving OLAP performance by over 70\% while meeting OLTP requirements

Publications
======
- **Sigmod 2024: Rethinking Learned Cost Models: Why Start from Scratch?**
[[paper]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3626769#artseq-00001)[[code]](https://github.com/yplusone/ParamTree)[[slides]](files/ParamTree_4.0.pptx)[[poster]](files/poster.pdf)

  Researched and developed ParamTree, a non-intrusive tool that optimizes DBMS cost models by using customized decision tree models to predict optimal hyperparameters.
